== Description ==

Script to make Sage changelogs.

== License ==

GNU General Public License, either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

== Authors ==

== Variables ==

The following variables MAY be set.  If not set, a default value will
be used.  In all cases, a non-existing directory will be created.

* VERSION: The new version of Sage.

* SAGE_MERGER_TOP (default: $HOME/merger): Fully qualified top working
directory, shared across Sage versions.  It is used as a default for
several other variables and is also used to extract Sage.

* LOGDIR (default: $DIST/logs): Directory where the log files of the
merger script will be written to.  Also the release notes will be put
here before Sage is built (so you can already look at the notes before
the build is finished).  This directory will be deleted and recreated
if it already exists.

* RELEASEURL (default: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release)
Where can Sage releases (old and new) be downloaded from?

* TRACURL (default: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac): URL for the
Sage Trac.

* RELEASEMANAGER (default: real name of current user): Real name of
the release manager.


== Hook functions ==

Before every step in the merge process above, a hook function is
called if defined in the merger script.  The name of the function is
the name of the step with "_hook" appended, for example
test_sage_hook().  If a function all_hook is defined, it will be run
before every step.  If a hook function sets the variable skip=yes, then
that particular step will be skipped.  Any non-zero return value is
treated as an error and will abort the merger.
