= merger =

== Description ==

Script to merge a new Sage version, i.e. to apply patches from Trac
to an existing Sage version and produce a new Sage version.

== License ==

GNU General Public License, either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

== Authors ==

 * Jeroen Demeyer <jdemeyer@cage.ugent.be>

== Variables ==

The following shell variable MUST be set in the main merge script:

* OLDVERSION: Old version of Sage (e.g. 4.7) to start from.  This old
version will automatically be downloaded from $RELEASEURL.


The following variables MAY be set.  If not set, a default value will
be used.  In all cases, a non-existing directory will be created.

* VERSION (default: the current directory name with a leading "sage-"
removed): The new version of Sage to be created (e.g. 4.7.1.alpha2).

* SAGE_MERGER_TOP (default: $HOME/merger): Fully qualified top working
directory, shared across Sage versions.  It is used as a default for
several other variables and is also used to extract Sage.

* TMPDIR (default: $SAGE_MERGER_TOP/tmp): Fast directory for extracting
spkgs, applying patches and compiling.  Hint: make $SAGE_MERGER_TOP/tmp
a symbolic link to some tmpfs file system.  This will speed up things.

* DOWNLOADS (default: $SAGE_MERGER_TOP/downloads): Directory for
downloads, shared across mergers.  Patches, spkgs and full Sage
distributions will be put here.  Also a file md5sums will be created
containing the MD5 checksums of the downloaded files.

* PATCHES (default: $SAGE_MERGER_TOP/patches): Directory for patches,
after they are downloaded and cleaned up (like adding ticket number to
commit message).  This is shared across mergers.

* BUILD (default: $SAGE_MERGER_TOP/sage-$VERSION): Directory used to
build the new Sage version.  This directory will be deleted and
recreated if it already exists.

* DIST (default: current working directory): Directory where the
resulting files (tarball, upgrade path, release notes,...) will be
stored by the dist-sage function.  Pre-existing Sage distributions here
will be overwritten.

* LOGDIR (default: $DIST/logs): Directory where the log files of the
merger script will be written to.  Also the release notes will be put
here before Sage is built (so you can already look at the notes before
the build is finished).  This directory will be deleted and recreated
if it already exists.

* RELEASEURL (default: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release)
Where can Sage releases (old and new) be downloaded from?

* TRACURL (default: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac): URL for the
Sage Trac.

* HG (default: sage --hg): Mercurial command.

* RELEASEMANAGER (default: real name of current user): Real name of
the release manager.

== Merge process ==

The merge process consists of the following steps.  The function
do_merge() must be defined in the merger script, all the others are
part of the merger package.

 * setup_logging

 * extract_old_tarball

 * setup_spkgs

 * extract_old_spkgs

 * do_merge

 * check_downloads

 * post_merge

 * build_sage

 * test_sage

 * dist_sage

 * check_spkg_hg

 * copy_dist


== Hook functions ==

Before every step in the merge process above, a hook function is
called if defined in the merger script.  The name of the function is
the name of the step with "_hook" appended, for example
test_sage_hook().  If a function all_hook is defined, it will be run
before every step.  If a hook function sets the variable skip=yes, then
that particular step will be skipped.  Any non-zero return value is
treated as an error and will abort the merger.
